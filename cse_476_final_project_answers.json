    "output": "Super Mario Land is a 1989 side-scrolling platform game developed and published by Nintendo as a launch title for their Game Boy handheld game console. It is the first \"Mario\" platform game ever to be released for a handheld console. In gameplay similar to that of the 1985 \"Super Mario Bros.\", but resized for the smaller device's screen, the player advances Mario to the end of 12 levels by moving to the right and jumping across platforms to avoid enemies and pitfalls. Unlike other \"Mario\" games, \"Super Mario Land\" is set in Sarasaland, a new environment depicted in line art, and Mario pursues Princess Daisy (who makes her debut in this game). The game introduces two \"Gradius\"-style shooter levels. Jazz Jackrabbit 2: Jazz Jackrabbit 2 is a platform game produced by Epic MegaGames, now known as Epic Games. It was accidentally confirmed by Arjan Brussee in 1994 and released in 1998 for PCs running Windows, and later for Macintosh computers. Like the prequel, \"Jazz Jackrabbit\", \"Jazz Jackrabbit 2\" is a side-scrolling platform game but features additional multiplayer options, including the ability to play over a LAN or the Internet. Shovel Knight: Shovel Knight is a 2D side-scrolling platform game developed and published by Yacht Club Games. Following a successful Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign, the game was initially released for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo 3DS and Wii U in June 2014, and ports of the game for OS X and Linux followed in September of the same year. Ports for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita and Xbox One were released in April 2015, the Amazon Fire TV in September 2015, and the Nintendo Switch in March 2017. \"Shovel Knight\" is inspired by gameplay and graphics of platformer games developed for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game has achieved critical acclaim and won various awards. Following the release of two additional campaigns, with a third currently in development, the original story received the retronym \"Shovel of Hope\", and the full game is referred to as Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove. Captain Comic: The Adventures of Captain Comic (or just Captain Comic) is a 1988 MS-DOS action-adventure platform game, reminiscent of \"Metroid\", and is one of the first side-scrolling platform games"

We are to find the **maximum** value of the expression:\n\n$$\n(A^2 + B^2)(a^2 + b^2)\n$$\n\n---\n\nLet us consider the function:\n\n$$\nf(x) = 1 - a \\cos x - b \\sin x - A \\cos 2x - B \\sin 2x\n$$\n\nWe can rewrite the trigonometric terms using vector notation. Let:\n\n$$\n\\vec{v} = \\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad \\vec{u} = \\begin{bmatrix} A \\\\ B \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nThen, the function becomes:\n\n$$\nf(x) = 1 - \\vec{v} \\cdot \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos x \\\\ \\sin x \\end{bmatrix} - \\vec{u} \\cdot \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos 2x \\\\ \\sin 2x \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nLet $ \\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{w} = |\\vec{v}||\\vec{w}|\\cos\\theta $, where $ \\theta $ is the angle between the vectors. Then:\n\n$$\nf(x) = 1 - |\\vec{v}||\\vec{w}_1|\\cos\\theta_1 - |\\vec{u}||\\vec{w}_2|\\cos\\theta_2\n$$\n\nWhere $ \\vec{w}_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos x \\\\ \\sin x \\end{bmatrix} $, $ \\vec{w}_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos 2x \\\\ \\sin 2x \\end{bmatrix} $, and $ |\\vec{w}_1| = |\\vec{w}_2| = 1 $.\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nf(x) = 1 - |\\vec{v}|\\cos\\theta_1 - |\\vec{u}|\\cos\\theta_2\n$$\n\nTo ensure $ f(x) \\ge 0 $ for all $ x $, we must have:\n\n$$\n1 \\ge |\\vec{"
